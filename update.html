                    <h3>Preserving History</h3>
                    With a new update comes a long list of changes that you might want to track. In the event that you'd
                    like to take a peek at previous release notes, you can look at the Changelog tab in the options page.
                    </p>

                <div id="new-features">
                    <h1>What's New</h1>
                    <p>For this update, changes were made to allow Rating Tracker to evolve beyond its simple beginnings.
                    There are some exciting ideas floating about that will eventually make their way to YOU, but there
                    are a list of chores that must be completed to get there. There's a particular focus on ensuring
                    the foundation being built upon is truly sturdy enough to handle the adventures being planned
                    into the future. Simplicity and usability are the pillars of this project. It works right out of the
                    box and doesn't cause you any grief after an update; and I'm proud to say that this extension is more
                    secure and user-friendly than before. </p>
                    <h4>Fresh Additions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Update Notifications - like this one!
                            <p>
                                Whenever an update is published, users will be notified of its changes. There was a
                                particular focus on making this unintrusive. Some browser extensions have a habit of flashing
                                their update news in your face. Rather than taking a flashy approach, the new update
                                notifications are entirely optional. You can even disable them, if you'd like.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Changelogs
                            <p>
                                All extension changes are now available through a changelog in the options page. This
                                has been designed for both utility and readability. You may browse through all previous
                                (and current) releases to see how the project has evolved over time.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Task completion notification
                            <p>
                                When a task reaches the AET, the text on the extension icon will display 'FIN'. This is
                                meant to help users missing the audio notifications and can be enabled/disabled through
                                the settings page.

                    <h4>Changes for the Ages</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved extension security
                            <p>
                                It is my belief that being proactive leads to great innovation. Several enhancements
                                have been identified that will allow Rating Tracker to be more robust in the event that
                                it encounters problems while tracking your work hours. It's better to be safe than sorry,
                                and now you can rest assured that Rating Tracker will notify you in the event that it
                                encounters problems while doing its job.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Improved timekeeping accuracy
                            <p>
                                When delays are encountered on the work website it's common to see a great disparity
                                between the internal Lionbridge timer (that can be enabled through the website settings
                                page) and the internal Rating Tracker timer. New measures have been introduced with
                                version 1.1.0 that should reduce this problem.
                            </p>
